I wanted to make the basic fundamental aspects of the game first (i.e. movement and grid) then I could update by prompting more.
I used Claude Code with Sonnet and I made it as a browser game using JavaScript and HTML5

1. i want to create a crossy road/frogger game. We can start off in 2d for now. To start I just want character that can move left, right, and forward (no backwards), and a grid that it can move on that updates when my character moves forward. For example i want one or a few tiles behind it and many tiles ahead, but when i move forward i want the screen to update so that the amount of tiles behind and infront of it stay the same

2. i want more rows ahead than behind, right now it is the opposite (included a screenshot of the current screen)

3. now there is gray in the first few rows of the screen, fix this please (included a screenshot)

4. it fixed it for when i first load in, but now when i move, it comes back (included screenshot)

!!! Switched to Claude Opus model

5. it did not fix, when i move forward it switches to have a gray first few rows (included screenshot)

6. great, now can i have a high score for this session, you can reset it whenever the screen reloads for now. update this when the user beats it. also now can you now make a game over screen for when i die (even though theres no way to die yet) and from that screen it should say "current score: ##" new line "high score: ##" new line "press any key to restart" from that screen when they press any screen it should restart them with a score of 0

7. awesome, now instead of random colors meaning nothing, can you make it so the blue is water and when stepped on, you die. and i want the grey to be rocks, so you cannot stand on that block, meaning if you are behind it and you try to move into it you stay on the same square

8. great, now can you make it not randomly generated as 1x1s, meaning whenever there is water, the water should make a river from left all the way right. also i make it so rocks can not form around spawn (there should always be atleast one grass block to the left, right, or infront of the spawn block) and there is always at least 1 grass block in a row

9. okay now that you can get trapped by rocks, can you add a backwards movement now (down arrow)

10. okay so when i move backwards from spawn there is void nothingness, can you fill this with 5 rows of rocks

11. great, now for the rivers, i want brown logs that float from left to right OR right to left, can i have at most 4 at a time on the screen and at least 2 at a time on screen, make them the same as grass blocks (meaning i can stand on them) but they move

12. it seems that some random rock formations, trap me in, can you make it so there is atleast one grass path that directly connects to a grass of the previous row for every row
